## Multi-Disease Detection System ##

## Overview 

The "Multi-Disease Detection System" is an ML-based solution that enables users to input their medical information and receive predictions about whether a particular disease is present or not. This project utilizes machine learning models to analyze the input data and provide accurate disease detection, aiming to assist in early diagnosis and healthcare decision-making.

The system is designed to detect multiple diseases with the help of trained models. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, it offers a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals and individuals alike.

## Features

- Multi-Disease Detection: Predict the presence of various diseases based on user input data.
- Machine Learning Models: Utilizes multiple machine learning models such as Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Logistic Regression for disease classification.
- Real-Time Interaction: User inputs their medical data, and the system provides instant detection results.
- Web Interface: A streamlined and intuitive interface powered by **Streamlit** for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for developing the machine learning models and backend logic.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework used to create an interactive user interface.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms such as **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** and **Logistic Regression** are used for disease detection.
- **Pickle**: Used for model serialization to store and load the trained models efficiently.

## How It Works

1. Input Data: The user provides input data such as symptoms, medical history, and other relevant health metrics through the web interface.
2. Prediction: The machine learning model processes the input data and predicts whether a particular disease is present or not.
3. Result Display: The system presents the results in an easy-to-understand format, highlighting whether the disease is detected.

## Models and Dataset

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Used for its robustness and ability to classify data with high accuracy.
- Logistic Regression: Effective for binary classification problems and disease detection based on patient data.
- Training Dataset: The models have been trained on a comprehensive medical dataset containing patient records and disease outcomes.

## Usage

1. Launch the web interface using the Streamlit app.
2. Enter the required health data into the input fields.
3. Click the **Predict** button to receive disease detection results.
4. View the predicted outcome and the doctor recommendation for further steps.
